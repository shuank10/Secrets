1>npm install passport-google-oauth20
2>we need to go Google Developers Console.
3>there we need to set up a new project.
4>After that, we'll go to credentials-> OAuth consent screen.
5>we can choose inernal.external.
6>After that we need to provide the app name- (for eg: here Secrets).
7>there are scopes option is also present
Add scope
Scopes are used to grant an application different levels of access on behalf of the end user.
8>Again we'll go to credentials,
there we'll add credentials -- OAuth client ID
9>choose the Application type-- here we'll use web app
10>Now two options are there-
a>Authorized JavaScript origins
The HTTP origins that host your web application.
This value can't contain wildcards or paths.
If you use a port other than 80, you must specify it. For example: https://example.com:8080 or
http://localhost:3000
b>Authorized redirect URIs
this will contain the URL, which user will see after getting authenticated by google.
eg:http://localhost:3000/auth/google/Secrets
HIT ENTER and CREATE

11>there you'll get a client_ud nad Client_secret
just copy paste it into your .env file.

12>Now got to your app.js


we need to install npm install mongoose-findorcreate

after a the login prompt which you'll get:

you will see Cannot GET /auth/google/secrets

so for this we need to create this route.
